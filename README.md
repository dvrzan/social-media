Social Media shows home view consisting of user names and their comments. User name and avatar are clickable and present a profile view that contains information about the clicked user.

Social Media uses https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com API to fetch users, posts, albums, and their photos.
Every JSON is a different endpoint.

## Concepts used

* MVC Design Pattern
* JSON parsing using Codable
* UITableView & UICollectionView
* HTTP requests with URLSession
* Data rendering with DispatchQueue
* Getting data from different API endpoints
