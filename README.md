A simple prototype social media app to show some basic concepts such as home screen showing names, avatars and posts, profile screen with detailed information about a contact, and albums list and pictures for each album. 

Social Media uses https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com API to fetch users, posts, albums, and their photos.
Every JSON is a different endpoint.

## Concepts used

* MVC Design Pattern
* JSON parsing using Codable
* UITableView & UICollectionView
* HTTP requests with URLSession
* Data rendering with DispatchQueue
* Getting data from different API endpoints
* Showing user's location using MapKit
